# BulletJump - a bullet jump plugin for Hytale 
This plugin implements the iconic bullet jump mechanic from Warframe - jump while sliding to explosively launch into the direction you're looking at.
## Compatibility
The plugin uses `MovementSettings.jumpForce` to determine the launch velocity for the jump - tweaking it will affect it.
Player should be able to trigger `sliding` and `jumping` `MovementStates` for the jump to trigger.
